*pKa values*

Why are pKas so important? Because every nucleophile is potentially a base, and vice versa. 
If you have a reaction where it looks like you might get SN2 or E2, look closely first – is there any chance of a simple acid-base reaction? 
For instance, take NaOH plus an alkyl thiol, R–SH. Is it an SN2? Or possibly an E2? Both are incorrect. 
The reaction that happens is the simplest one – deprotonation of SH, to provide water and the deprotonated thiol.
Also, the pKa table tells you about leaving group ability. Good leaving groups are weak bases!
